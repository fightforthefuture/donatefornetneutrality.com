Corporations should have no right to restrict or favor any internet traffic over another. In contrast to the lies of Ajit Pai we have seen corporations such as Verizon, Comcast and others attempt to do just that prior to the previous net neutrality laws (which did not go far enough to protect the internet). Please do what we we elected you to do and represent the American people in this and not lobbyists for corporations. We will be watching how you vote.",
